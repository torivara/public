# Public repository

This is my public repository where you will find PowerShell scripts, Terraform files, ARM templates, and other stuff I reference from my blog.

All of the information in this repository is free to use and change as you like. I take no responsibility for any damages it might cause anywhere, as not all of these snippets are production ready.

## Repository purpose

There will be several sub folders containing scripts and code I want to be publicly available.
